# Nyaya AI - Sovereign Legal Intelligence Platform

## 🔍 Project Overview

Nyaya AI is a sovereign-compliant multi-agent legal intelligence platform designed to provide transparent, auditable legal analysis across multiple jurisdictions (India, UK, UAE). The system follows a modular architecture that ensures:

- **Sovereign Provenance**: Complete audit trail with signed events and hash chaining
- **Multi-jurisdictional Support**: Legal analysis across India, UK, and UAE jurisdictions
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Special handling for Indian constitutional law
- **Real-time Feedback**: Reinforcement learning engine for continuous improvement
- **API-first Design**: Clean, well-documented RESTful endpoints

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The Nyaya AI backend is composed of 7 core modules that work together to provide a comprehensive legal intelligence platform:

### 1. API Gateway (FastAPI)
- Entry point for all client requests
- Handles authentication, rate limiting, and request routing
- Provides standardized response formats
- Implements CORS and security middleware
- **NEW**: Integrated with sovereign enforcement engine for governance checks

### 2. Sovereign Agents
- **BaseAgent**: Core functionality with ID, jurisdiction, and capabilities
- **LegalAgent**: Specialized for legal query processing
- **ConstitutionalAgent**: Handles constitutional law references (India-specific)
- **JurisdictionRouterAgent**: Routes queries to appropriate legal agents

### 3. Jurisdiction Router
- **Resolver Pipeline**: Determines the most appropriate jurisdiction for queries
- **Confidence Aggregator**: Combines confidence scores from multiple agents
- **Fallback Manager**: Handles low-confidence scenarios with alternative jurisdictions

### 4. Sovereign Enforcement Engine
- **Enforcement Engine**: Makes deterministic governance decisions (ALLOW/SOFT_REDIRECT/BLOCK/ESCALATE)
- **Rules Engine**: Applies constitutional, jurisdictional, safety, and compliance rules
- **Decision Model**: Standardized decision objects with rule_id, policy_source, and reasoning
- **Signer**: Cryptographic signing of all enforcement decisions

### 5. Governed Execution Pipeline
- **Execution Control**: Ensures all agent execution passes through enforcement
- **Fallback Handler**: Governs fallback procedures
- **RL Controller**: Regulates reinforcement learning updates

### 6. RL Engine (Reinforcement Learning)
- **Feedback Processor**: Receives and processes user feedback
- **Performance Memory**: Stores agent performance metrics
- **Reward Engine**: Computes +reward/-penalty based on feedback scores (1-5)

### 7. Provenance Chain
- **Event Signer**: Signs all events using HMAC-SHA256
- **Hash Chain Ledger**: Immutable chain of signed events
- **Lineage Tracer**: Tracks request lineage and provides audit trails
- **Nonce Manager**: Prevents replay attacks
- **Enforcement Ledger**: Logs all enforcement decisions, agent executions, and system events

### 8. Data Bridge
- **JSON Loader**: Safely loads legal datasets without modification
- **Validator**: Ensures data integrity and schema compliance
- **Standard Schemas**: Section, Act, and Case objects with jurisdiction tags

### 9. Case Law Retrieval System
- **Case Law Loader**: Loads judicial precedents from JSON files
- **Case Law Retriever**: Keyword-based matching for relevant precedents
- **Domain Filtering**: Returns only cases matching query domain
- **Jurisdiction Filtering**: Returns only cases from relevant jurisdiction
- **Top-K Selection**: Returns most relevant 3 cases per query

### 10. Jurisdiction Detection System
- **Jurisdiction Detector**: Automatically infers jurisdiction from user queries
- **Keyword Heuristics**: Detects legal acts, terms, geographic indicators, currency
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides 0.0-1.0 confidence for detection accuracy
- **User Hint Precedence**: User-provided hints always override automatic detection
- **Default Behavior**: Falls back to India (IN) with 0.5 confidence when no indicators found

## 🔐 Provenance & Security

### Event Signing
All events in the system are signed using HMAC-SHA256 with a configurable secret key. This ensures:
- Non-repudiation of events
- Integrity verification
- Audit trail authenticity

### Enforcement Decision Signing
All enforcement decisions are cryptographically signed to ensure:
- Authenticity of governance decisions
- Tamper-proof approval/rejection records
- Verifiable compliance with sovereignty rules

### Hash Chain
The provenance chain uses a linked-list structure where each event contains:
- Index in the chain
- Timestamp
- Event hash (SHA256 of the signed event)
- Previous event hash (creating the chain)
- Signed event data

### Enforcement Ledger
The sovereign enforcement ledger logs:
- All enforcement decisions (ALLOW, SOFT_REDIRECT, BLOCK, ESCALATE)
- Agent executions with governance approval
- Routing decisions with compliance verification
- RL updates with safety checks
- Refusals and escalations with justification

### Nonce Protection
A nonce system prevents replay attacks by ensuring each request has a unique, one-time use token.

### Trace Retrieval
Full audit trails can be retrieved using trace IDs, providing complete visibility into:
- Agent routing decisions
- Jurisdiction transitions
- Event signatures
- Chain integrity verification
- Enforcement approvals and rejections
- Governance compliance verification

## 🎯 RL Engine Explanation

### What is Rewarded
- High user ratings (4-5 stars)
- Positive feedback on clarity, correctness, and usefulness
- Successful query completions
- Accurate jurisdiction routing

### What is Penalized
- Low user ratings (1-2 stars)
- Negative feedback
- Incorrect legal information
- Low confidence responses
- Failed jurisdiction routing

### What is NOT Learned
- The system does NOT perform machine learning training
- No model weights are updated
- No neural network training occurs
- The system only adjusts confidence scores and routing decisions based on feedback
